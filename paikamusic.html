              <h2>Goal</h2>
              <p>The platform aims to provide students like Vijay with quick, relevant solutions to their ICT issues through a responsive and well-organized community interface. The goal is to reduce frustration and improve learning by making help accessible anytime, anywhere</p>

              <h3>Vijay's Problem Statement:</h3>
              <p>
                Vijay struggles to find a platform that provides easy access to fresh, independent music while also fostering a strong artist-listener connection. Existing music streaming services focus more on mainstream artists, making it difficult for emerging musicians to gain visibility and for passionate listeners like Vijay to discover unique sounds.

            <div class="problem">
              <h3>Namgay's Problem Statement:</h3>
              <p>
                Namgay is a socially conscious listener who wants to enjoy music ethically but finds it difficult to verify if streaming platforms truly compensate artists fairly. He is hesitant to subscribe to a service that does not align with his values, leading to frustration in his music consumption choices.

          <p class="intro-text">
            Music streaming has become the primary way people discover and enjoy songs, but in Bhutan, local artists often struggle to reach listeners through international platforms that prioritize global hits over regional content. While services like Spotify and YouTube allow users to play any song on demand, they don't actively promote Bhutanese music or support local musicians fairly. Recognizing this gap, we created a Bhutanese-focused music platform that gives listeners complete freedom to explore and play any song they choose—whether traditional folk, modern rigsar, or emerging indie tracks—while ensuring artists get proper recognition.

  <!-- Methodology -->
  <h3>Methodology</h3>
  <p>To evaluate the usability and effectiveness of our Bhutanese-focused music platform, we conducted two types of studies:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Moderated Usability Study:</strong> For in-depth user interactions and real-time feedback on discoverability, artist support, and cultural relevance.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h4>Moderated Usability Study</h4>
  <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Understand how Bhutanese users navigate the platform, discover local artists, and perceive fairness in artist compensation.</p>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 27, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10-15 minutes per session</p>
  
  <h5>Key Focus Areas:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Ease of finding Bhutanese music vs. international tracks</li>
    <li>Perceptions of artist recognition and support</li>
    <li>Initial impressions of onboarding experience (Login/Signup)</li>
    <li>Song categorization and discoverability by genre</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h5>Participants</h5>
  <p>The study included a total of 5 participants, consisting of 3 male and 2 female.</p>
  <p><strong>User Profiles:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Casual Listeners – Explore new Bhutanese music casually.</li>
    <li>Ethical Consumers – Prioritize platforms that support Bhutanese artists transparently.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Moderated Usability Study Script</h4>
  <p><strong>Facilitator Introduction:</strong> "Welcome! Our platform is designed to amplify Bhutanese artists—unlike global streaming services that often overlook them. As you test it today, focus on how well it helps you discover local music and support Bhutanese musicians. Your feedback will help us improve the experience for artists and listeners alike."</p>
  
  <h5>Tasks & Follow-Up Questions</h5>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Discover a new independent Bhutanese artist.</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow-up: "Was it easier to find local artists here compared to platforms like Spotify or YouTube? How could we make discovery even better?"</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Create a personalized playlist (5+ songs).</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow-up: "Did the platform suggest relevant Bhutanese tracks? Were there any frustrations while building your playlist?"</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Share a song or playlist.</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow-up: "Would you use this feature to promote Bhutanese music? What social features do you think are missing?"</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Evaluate the Login/Signup experience.</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow-up: "Did you face any issues during the login or signup process? How could we improve it for first-time users?"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>User Feedback: One participant expressed dislike for the current design of the login and signup pages, stating that it felt outdated and visually unappealing.</p>
      <p>Suggestion: Update the Login/Signup UI to have a more modern, user-friendly, and visually appealing design, with intuitive layout, consistent color schemes, and possibly support for social login options (e.g., Google, Facebook).</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Explore music categories.</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow-up: "Did you feel the platform helped you explore different types of Bhutanese music?"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>User Suggestion: Users suggested organizing songs into clearly defined categories such as Rigsar, Old Songs, New Songs, and Rap to improve discovery and browsing. They felt that genre-based categorization would make the listening experience more personalized and intuitive.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
